# adventofcode2023
Attempting the Advent of Code 2023, while also learning Kotlin. All solutions are designed such that the corresponding input must be labeled as "DayXInput.txt" and must also be placed in the (nonexistent) "resources" directory under main. Putting that in the gitignore so I don't accidentally commit puzzle inputs.
